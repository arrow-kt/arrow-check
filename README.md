## Credits

Λrrow Check comes from [`propCheck`](https://github.com/1Jajen1/propCheck) by [Jannis](https://github.com/1Jajen1). 

It started as a port of [QuickCheck](https://github.com/nick8325/quickcheck) and lately of the [Hedgehog](https://github.com/hedgehogqa/haskell-hedgehog) Haskell library.

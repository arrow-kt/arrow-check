# Λrrow Check: Property-based testing in Kotlin

> Never write test data by hand again. Generate it!

Λrrow Check is part of [**Λrrow**](https://arrow-kt.io).

Global properties come from [**arrow**](https://github.com/arrow-kt/arrow) repository.

## Credits

Λrrow Check comes from [`propCheck`](https://github.com/1Jajen1/propCheck) by [Jannis](https://github.com/1Jajen1). 

It started as a port of [QuickCheck](https://github.com/nick8325/quickcheck) and lately of the [Hedgehog](https://github.com/hedgehogqa/haskell-hedgehog) Haskell library.
